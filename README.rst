PyRoboLearn
===========

**NOTE**: As python 2.7 is no more supported, a lot of the code in this repo will be ported to python 3 in this new branch. Extra features will also be added as time goes on.

This repository contains the code for the *PyRoboLearn* (PRL) framework: a Python framework for Robot Learning.
This framework revolves mainly around 7 axes: simulators, worlds, robots, interfaces, learning tasks (= environment and policy), learning models, and learning algorithms. 

**Warning**: The development of this framework is ongoing, and thus some substantial changes might occur. Sorry for the inconvenience.


Requirements
------------

The framework has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6, on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. The installation on other OS is
experimental.


Installation
------------

There are two ways to install the framework:

1. using a virtual environment and pip
2. using a Docker


Virtualenv & Pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First download the ``pip`` Python package manager and create a virtual environment for Python as described in the following link: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/
On Ubuntu, you can install ``pip`` and ``virtualenv`` by typing in the terminal: 

- In Python 2.7:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt install python-pip
	sudo pip install virtualenv

- In Python 3.5:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt install python3-pip
	sudo pip install virtualenv

You can then create the virtual environment by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

	virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python<version> <virtualenv_name>
	# activate the virtual environment
	source <virtualenv_name>/bin/activate

where ``<version>`` is the python version you want to use (select between ``2.7`` or ``3.5``), and ``<virtualenv_name>`` is a name of your choice for the virtual environment. For instance, it can be ``py2.7`` or ``py3.5``.

To deactivate the virtual environment, just type:

.. code-block:: bash

	deactivate

2. clone this repository and install the requirements by executing the ``setup.py``

In Python 2.7:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/robotlearn/pyrobolearn
	cd pyrobolearn
	pip install numpy cython
	pip install http://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/archive/alpha.zip  # this is for Python 2.7
	pip install -e .  # this will install pyrobolearn as well as the required packages (so no need for: pip install -r requirements.txt)

In Python 3.5:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/robotlearn/pyrobolearn
	cd pyrobolearn
	pip install numpy cython
	pip install gpytorch  # this is for Python 3.5
	pip install -e .  # this will install pyrobolearn as well as the required packages (so no need for: pip install -r requirements.txt)

Depending on your computer configuration and the python version you use, you might need to install also the following packages through ``apt-get``:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt install python-tk  # if python 2.7
	sudo apt install python3-tk  # if python 3.5


Docker
~~~~~~

At the moment the docker is a self contained Ubuntu image with all the libraries installed. When launched we have access to a Python3.6 interpreter and we can import pyrobolearn directly.
In the future, ROS may be splitted in another container and linked to this one.

1. Install Docker and nvidia-docker

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable # you should replace bionic by your version
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install docker-ce
	sudo systemctl status docker # check that docker is active

2. Build the image

.. code-block:: bash

	docker build -t pyrobolearn .


3. Launch


You can now start the python interpreter with every library already installed

.. code-block:: bash

	docker run -p 11311:11311 -v $PWD/dev:/pyrobolearn/dev/:rw -ti pyrobolearn python3


To open an interactive terminal in the docker image use:

.. code-block:: bash

	docker run -p 11311:11311 -v $PWD/dev:/pyrobolearn/dev/:rw -ti pyrobolearn /bin/bash


4. nvidia-docker
if the GPU is not recognized in the interpreter, you can install nvidia-docker

.. code-block:: bash
	
	curl -sL https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
	distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
	curl -sL https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install nvidia-docker2
	sudo pkill -SIGHUP dockerd

And use:

.. code-block:: bash

	nvidia-docker run -p 11311:11311 -v $PWD/dev:/pyrobolearn/dev/:rw -ti pyrobolearn


Other Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that some interfaces (like game controllers, depth camera, etc) might not be available on other OS, however the 
main robotic framework should work.

1. Windows: You will have to install first PyBullet and NLopt beforehand.

For nlopt, install first ``conda``, then type:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda install -c conda-forge nlopt

If Pybullet doesn't install on Windows (using visual studio), you might have to copy ``rc.exe`` and ``rc.dll`` from

``C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\<xx.x.xxxx.x>\x64``

to

``C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86``

And add the last folder to the Windows environment path (Go to ``System Properties`` > ``Advanced`` > ``Environment Variables`` > ``Path`` 
> ``Edit``).

Finally, remove the nlopt package from the ``requirements.txt``. The rest of the installation should be straightforward.


2. Mac OSX: We managed to install the PyRoboLearn framework on MacOSX (Mojave) by following the procedures explained in the section 
"Virtualenv & Pip". You can replace the ``sudo apt install`` by ``brew install`` (after installing `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_).
