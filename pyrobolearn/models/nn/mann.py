"""Provide the various memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs).

This file provides the various MANNs; a parametric, generally non-linear, recurrent with memory, discriminative,
and deterministic model.

These kinds of model includes "Neural Turing Machines".

The code presented here is mostly inspired by [4, 5, 6, 7] and sometimes loosely inspired by [8,9].
