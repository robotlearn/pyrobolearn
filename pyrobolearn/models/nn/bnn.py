r"""Provide Bayesian Neural Networks.

This file provides Bayesian neural networks which add uncertainty to the the prediction of NNs. In a bayesian neural
network, the weights and biases have a prior probability distribution attached to them. The posterior distribution on
these parameters is computed after training the model on some data.

Several approaches to learning Bayesian neural networks have been proposed in the literature:
- Laplace approximation [5,4]
- Monte Carlo
- MC Dropout [8,9]
- Variational Inference (Bayes by Backprop [7,10])
