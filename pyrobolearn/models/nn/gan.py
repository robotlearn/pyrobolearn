"""Define the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) learning model.

This file provides the GAN model; a parametric, generally non-linear, non-recurrent, generative, and stochastic model.
This is a generative model which works in a game theory setting by having a generator and discriminator compete
between each other. The goal of the generator is to generate data samples that are similar to the provided dataset
and fool the discriminator. The goal of the discriminator is to discriminate the given samples by identifying the fake
ones from the true ones.

We decided to use the `pytorch` framework because of its popularity in the research community field, flexibility,
similarity with numpy (but with automatic differentiation: autograd), GPU capabilities, and more Pythonic approach.
While we thought about using other frameworks (such as Keras, Tensorflow, and others) as well, it would have
unnecessarily complexify the whole framework, as these frameworks would not only influence the learning models,
but also the losses, optimizers, and other modules. While we could have written some interfaces that makes the bridge
between these various frameworks and ours, we came to the conclusion that this would take a considerable amount of
efforts and time that we do not have for the moment.

class GAN(NN):
    r"""Generative Adversarial Network

    Type: generative model

    Generative adversarial networks are two networks, a generator and a discriminator competing against each other.
    The generator tries to produce fake data that are similar to the real data such that the discriminator can not
    distinguished the fake data from the real one [1,2]. Once trained the generator is trained to generate samples
    that are similar to the original data distribution.

    Several GAN models implemented in PyTorch are provided in [3].

    Note that with multiple layers, the networks become sensitive to the initial values of the weights and will fail
    to train. This problem can be solved by using batch normalization [2] for the layers (except the output layer for
    the generator and the input layer of the discriminator). The use of Leaky ReLU for the layers in the discriminator
    is also advised in order to propagate the gradients for negative values. The use of ReLU or Leaky ReLU is advised
    for the generator except the last layer which has been shown to perform the best with a tanh layer. The last layer
    for the discriminator should be a sigmoid function with 0 indicating that the data is fake and 1 the data comes
    from the real data distribution.

    The loss being minimized for the discriminator is the sum of the losses for real and fake images using the sigmoid
    cross-entropy loss for each one of them. That is, the predicted logit outputs of the discriminator on the real
    data should be as close as possible to the label 1, while on the fake data the labels should be 0.
    As for the generator, the loss being optimized is the sigmoid cross entropy loss taken on the discriminator output
    logits but such that the labels are 1 for the fake data.
    With these losses, it can be seen that the generator is trying to fool the discriminator while the discriminator
    is trying to distinguish between the real and fake data.
