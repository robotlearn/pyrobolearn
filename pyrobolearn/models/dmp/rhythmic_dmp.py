class RhythmicDMP(DMP):
    r"""Rhythmic Dynamic Movement Primitive

    Rhythmic DMPs have the same mathematical formulation as general DMPs, which is given by:

    .. math:: \tau^2 \ddot{y} = K (g - y) - D \tau \dot{y} + f(s)

    where :math:`\tau` is a scaling factor that allows to slow down or speed up the reproduced movement, :math:`K`
    is the stiffness coefficient, :math:`D` is the damping coefficient, :math:`y, \dot{y}, \ddot{y}` are the position,
    velocity, and acceleration of a DoF, and :math:`f(s)` is the non-linear forcing term.

    However, the forcing term in the case of rhythmic DMPs is given by:

    .. math:: f(s) = \frac{\sum_i \psi_i(s) w_i}{\sum_i \psi_i(s)} a

    where :math:`w` are the learnable weight parameters, and :math:`\psi` are the basis functions evaluated at the
    given input phase variable :math:`s`, and :math:`a` is the amplitude.

    The basis functions (in the rhythmic case) are given by:

    .. math:: \psi_i(s) = \exp \left( - h_i (\cos(s - c_i) - 1) \right)

    where :math:`c_i` is the center of the basis, and :math:`h_i` is a measure of concentration.

    Also, the canonical system associated with this transformation system is given by:

    .. math:: \tau \dot{s} = 1

    where :math:`\tau` is a scaling factor that allows to slow down or speed up the movement, and :math:`s` is the
    phase variable that drives the DMP.

    All these differential equations are solved using Euler's method.
