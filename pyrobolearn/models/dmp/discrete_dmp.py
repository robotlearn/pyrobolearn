class DiscreteDMP(DMP):
    r"""Discrete Dynamic Movement Primitive

    Discrete DMPs have the same mathematical formulation as general DMPs, which is given by:

    .. math:: \tau^2 \ddot{y} = K (g - y) - D \tau \dot{y} + f(s) (g - y0)

    where :math:`\tau` is a scaling factor that allows to slow down or speed up the reproduced movement, :math:`K`
    is the stiffness coefficient, :math:`D` is the damping coefficient, :math:`y, \dot{y}, \ddot{y}` are the position,
    velocity, and acceleration of a DoF, and :math:`f(s)` is the non-linear forcing term.

    However, the forcing term in the case of discrete DMPs is given by:

    .. math:: f(s) = \frac{\sum_i \psi_i(s) w_i}{\sum_i \psi_i(s)} s

    where :math:`w` are the learnable weight parameters, and :math:`\psi` are the basis functions evaluated at the
    given input phase variable :math:`s`, :math:`g` is the goal, and :math:`y_0` is the initial position. Note that
    as the phase converges to 0, the forcing term also converges to that value.

    The basis functions (in the discrete case) are given by:

    .. math:: \psi_i(s) = \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2 \sigma_i^2} (x - c_i)^2 \right)

    where :math:`c_i` is the center of the basis function :math:`i`, and :math:`\sigma_i` is its width.

    Also, the canonical system associated with this transformation system is given by:

    .. math:: \tau \dot{s} = - \alpha_s s

    where :math:`\tau` is a scaling factor that allows to slow down or speed up the movement, :math:`s` is the phase
    variable that drives the DMP, and :math:`\alpha_s` is a predefined constant.

    All these differential equations are solved using Euler's method.
