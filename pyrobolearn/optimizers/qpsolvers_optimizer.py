class QP(Optimizer):
    r"""Quadratic Programming solvers

    This class uses the `qpsolvers` which is a unified Python interface for multiple QP solvers [1,2].

    .. math::

        \min_{x \in R^n} \frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x

    subject to

    .. math::

        Gx \leq h
        Ax = b

    where :math:`x` is the vector of optimization variables, the matrix :math:`P` and vector :math:`q` are used to
    define any quadratic objective function on these variables, while the matrix-vector couples :math:`(G,h)` and
    :math:`(A,b)` respectively define inequality and equality constraints. Vector inequalities apply coordinate by
    coordinate [1].

    - Dense solvers:
        - CVXOPT
        - CVXPY
        - qpOASES
        - quadprog
    - Sparse solvers:
        - ECOS as wrapped by CVXPY
        - Gurobi
        - MOSEK
        - OSQP

    Check the available solvers by calling `print(qpsolvers.available_solvers)`.

    Notes: Many solvers (including CVXOPT, OSQP and quadprog) assume that `P` is a symmetric matrix, and may return
    erroneous results when that is not the case. You can set ``sym_proj=True`` to project `P` on its symmetric part,
    at the cost of some computation time.
