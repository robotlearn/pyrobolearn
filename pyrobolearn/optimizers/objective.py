r"""Define the objective function in an optimization problem.

A constrained optimization problem is generally given by:

.. math:: \min_{x \in R^n} f(x)

subject to

.. math::

        g_L \leq g(x) \leq g_U
        x_L \leq  x  \leq x_U

where :math:`f` is the objective function, :math:`x` are the variables that are being optimized, :math:`(x_L, x_U)`
are the lower and upper bound on these variables, :math:`g` is a constraint function that maps the variables :math:`x`
to another space, and :math:`(g_L, g_U)` are the lower and upper bound in that space.
