"""Define the IMU sensor used in robotics.

'An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force,
angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surroundings the body, using a combination of accelerometers
and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers' [1]

class IMUSensor(LinkSensor):
    r"""Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor.

    The IMU sensor measures the linear and angular motion using accelerometers and gyroscopes. Specifically,
    3-axis accelerometers allow to measure the accelerations along its axes, and 3-axis gyroscopes measure the
    angular velocities around its axes. Sometimes, theses sensors also have a 3-axis magnetometer which measures
    the magnetic field. [1]

    Note that real IMUs typically accumulate errors over time, and thus the integrated values drift over time.

    A very wide variety of IMUs exists, depending on application types, with performance ranging [:

    - from 0.1 deg/s to 0.001 deg/h for gyroscope
    - from 100 mg to 10^{-6}g for accelerometers
