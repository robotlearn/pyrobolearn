    WARNING: Currently, pybullet does not simulate fluids, so we simulate the thrust, drag, buoyancy, lift, and weight
    forces acting on the body. The gravity/weight force is simulated by pybullet.

    The various forces are given by [3,4]:

    1. The gravity/weight force is due to the attraction pull of the Earth is given by:

    .. math:: F_g = m g

    where :math:`m` is the mass of the object, and :math:`g` is the gravity constant (which is around
    :math:`9.81 m/s^2` on the earth).

    2. The buoyancy force is given by:

    .. math:: F_b = \rho g V

    where :math:`\rho` is the fluid density, :math:`g` is the gravity constant, and `V` is the volume of the
    body submerged in the fluid.

    3. The thrust force is due to the engine/motor/propeller of the object:

    .. math:: F_t = \dot{m}_e v_e - \dot{m}_0 v_0 + (p_e - p_0) A_e

    where :math:`\dot{m} = \rho A v` is the mass flow rate (i.e. mass/time), :math:`\rho` is the fluid density,
    :math:`v` is the velocity, :math:`A` is the area where its normal is parallel to fluid flow, :math:`p` is the
    pressure. The indices :math:`e` and :math:`0` stands for the exit and free stream (at the front of the submarine).

    4. The lift force is given by:

    .. math:: F_l = 1/2 C_l \rho A v^2

    where :math:`C_l` is the lift coefficient at the desired angle of attack, :math:`A` is the platform area, \rho is
    the fluid density, and :math:`v` is the velocity.

    5. The drag force (which is opposed to the movement) is given by:

    .. math:: F_d = 1/2 C_d \rho A v^2

    where :math:`C_d` is the drag coefficient which is depending on the shape of the object, friction and viscosity
    of the fluid, :math:`\rho` is the fluid density, :math:`A` is the platform area, and :math:`v` is the velocity.
    For a submarine, the coefficient is approximately around 0.04 (see [3]).
