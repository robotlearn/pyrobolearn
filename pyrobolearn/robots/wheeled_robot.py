    r"""Differential Wheeled Robot

    "A differential wheeled robot is a mobile robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed
    on either side of the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of
    its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion. To balance the robot, additional wheels or
    casters may be added." [1]

    Check also [2] for the different types of drive.

    The kinematics of these kind of platforms (with two wheels) can be described mathematically by [4]:

    .. math::

        v &= \frac{r (\omega_R +  \omega_L)}{2} \\
        \omega &= \frac{r (\omega_R - \omega_L)}{d}

    where :math:`\omega_R` (resp. :math:`\omega_L`) is the angular velocity of the right (resp. left) wheel,
    :math:`v` is the driving velocity of the platform, :math:`\omega` is its steering velocity, :math:`r` is the
    radius of the wheels and :math:`d` is the distance between their centers.

    This formulation is equivalent to:

    .. math::

        \omega_R &= v + \frac{d}{2r} \omega \\
        \omega_L &= v - \frac{d}{2r} \omega
