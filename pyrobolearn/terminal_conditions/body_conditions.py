           and results in a failure. (all=True, out=False, stay=True)
        2. in a certain bounds and must get out of these bounds. Once they all get out, the terminal condition is over,
           and results in a success. (all=True, out=False, stay=False)
        3. outside a certain bounds and must get in. Once they all get in, the terminal condition is over, and results
           in a success. (all=True, out=True, stay=False)
        4. outside a certain bounds and must stay outside these ones. Once one gets in, the terminal condition is over,
           and results in a failure. (all=True, out=True, stay=True)
    2. any of the dimension of the body state is:

class BaseOrientationAxisCondition(BodyCondition):
    r"""Base orientation axis terminal condition

    This uses the cosine similarity function by computing the angle between the given axis and one of the axis
    of the base orientation (i.e. one of the columns of the rotation matrix).

    This terminal condition describes 4 cases (2 failure and 2 success cases); the angle is in:

    1. in a certain bounds and must stay between these bounds. Once it gets out, the terminal condition is over,
       and results in a failure. (stay=True, out=False --> must stay in)
    2. in a certain bounds and must get out of these bounds. Once it gets out, the terminal condition is over,
       and results in a success. (stay=False, out=False --> must not stay in)
    3. outside a certain bounds and must get in. Once it gets in, the terminal condition is over, and results
       in a success. (stay=False, out=True --> must not stay out)
    4. outside a certain bounds and must stay outside these ones. Once it gets in, the terminal condition is over,
       and results in a failure. (stay=True, out=True --> must stay out)
