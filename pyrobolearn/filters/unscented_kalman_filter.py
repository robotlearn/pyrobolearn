    r"""Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)

    Type: Derivative-free Gaussian filter (=Bayes filter for continuous spaces)

    This is an extension and generalization to the standard Kalman filter which also works with nonlinear systems.
    This filter is an alternative to deal with non-linear process/measurement models, using :math:`\sigma`-points
    to approximate the probability distribution. Specifically, as EKF, it linearizes the transformation of a Gaussian,
    but instead of doing it via a Taylor expansion, it "performs a stochastic linearization through the use of
    a weighted statistical linear regression process". [1]

    The dynamic model :math:`p(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_t)` and the measurement model :math:`p(z_t | x_t)` are given by:

    .. math::

        x_t = f(x_{t-1}, u_t) + \epsilon_t \qquad \mbox{where} \qquad \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R_t)
        z_t = h(x_t) + \delta_t \qquad \mbox{where} \qquad \delta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, Q_t)

    where :math:`f` and :math:`h` are nonlinear functions.

    The UKF works by generating :math:`2n+1` :math:`sigma`-points, and pass them through the corresponding dynamical
    and measurement functions, and compute from them a weighted empirical mean and covariance.

    Notes:
        - Compared to EKF, this filter does not require to compute the Jacobians for the dynamical and measurement
        models, and is thus a derivative-free filter. "If the belief is highly non-Gaussian, then the UKF
        representation is too restrictive and the filter can perform arbitrarily poorly" [1]
        - An extension to multimodal posteriors is known as multi-hypothesis Kalman filter which uses a mixture of
        Gaussians. See also, the histogram and particle filters that are well-suited to represent complex multimodal
        beliefs. [1]

    Complexity: "The asympototic complexity of the UKF algorithm is the same as for the EKF. In practice, the EKF is
        often slightly faster than the UKF. Nevertheless, the UKF is still highly efficient" [1]
