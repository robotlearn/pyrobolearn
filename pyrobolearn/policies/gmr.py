        Initialize the GMR policy.

        Args:
            action (Action): At each step, by calling `policy.act(state)`, the `action` is computed by the policy,
              and can be given to the environment. As with the `state`, the type and size/shape of each inner
              action can be inferred and could be used to automatically build a policy. The `action` connects the
              policy with a controllable object (such as a robot) in the environment.
            state (State): By giving the `state` to the policy, it can automatically infer the type and size/shape
              of each inner state, and thus can be used to automatically build a policy. At each step, the `state`
              is filled by the environment, and read by the policy. The `state` connects the policy with one or
              several objects (including robots) in the environment. Note that some policies don't use any state
              information.
            num_components (int): the number of components/gaussians (this argument should be provided if
              no priors, means, covariances, or gaussians are provided)
            priors (list/tuple of float, None): prior probabilities (they have to be positives). If not provided,
              it will be a uniform distribution.
            means (list of np.array[float[D]], None): list of means
            covariances (list of np.array[float[D,D]], None): list of covariances
            gaussians (list of Gaussian, None): list of gaussians. If provided, the `means` and `covariances`
              parameters don't have to be provided.
            rate (int, float): rate (float) at which the policy operates if we are operating in real-time. If we are
              stepping deterministically in the simulator, it represents the number of ticks (int) to sleep before
              executing the model.
            preprocessors (Processor, list of Processor, None): pre-processors to be applied to the given input
            postprocessors (Processor, list of Processor, None): post-processors to be applied to the output
            *args (list): list of arguments (this is not used in this class).
