    r"""NEAT Policy

    NEAT stands for "Neuro-Evolution through Augmenting Topologies" [1] and allows the evolution of not only the
    parameters/weights but also the topological structure of neural networks. The model associated with this
    policy (i.e. the neural network) is tightly coupled with the algorithm that modifies it.
    By the structure of the neural network, we mean the type (i.e. forward or recurrent) and number of connection,
    as well as the type (i.e. using non-linearity activation function) and number of nodes can change.

    Exploration is thus carried out in the parameter and hyper-parameter spaces.

    Warnings: The associated algorithm is a little bit special and currently only works with the corresponding
    policy/learning model.

        Args:
            action (Action): At each step, by calling `policy.act(state)`, the `action` is computed by the policy,
                and can be given to the environment. As with the `state`, the type and size/shape of each inner
                action can be inferred and could be used to automatically build a policy. The `action` connects the
                policy with a controllable object (such as a robot) in the environment.
            state (State): By giving the `state` to the policy, it can automatically infer the type and size/shape
                of each inner state, and thus can be used to automatically build a policy. At each step, the `state`
                is filled by the environment, and read by the policy. The `state` connects the policy with one or
                several objects (including robots) in the environment. Note that some policies don't use any state
                information.
            num_hidden (int): number of units in the hidden layer
            activation_fct (str): activation function to use.
            network_type (str): type of neural network. Select between 'feedforward' and 'recurrent'.
            aggregation (str): how to aggregate the input signals of a node. Select between 'sum', 'product', 'max',
                'min', 'maxabs', 'median', and 'mean'.
            weights_limits (tuple): weight limits / bounds. The tuple contains the lower and upper bounds.
            bias_limits (tuple): bias limits / bounds. The tuple contains the lower and upper bounds.
            rate (int, float): rate (float) at which the policy operates if we are operating in real-time. If we are
                stepping deterministically in the simulator, it represents the number of ticks (int) to sleep before
                executing the model.
            preprocessors (Processor, list of Processor, None): pre-processors to be applied to the given input
            postprocessors (Processor, list of Processor, None): post-processors to be applied to the output
