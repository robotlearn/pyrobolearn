"""Define the `Experiment` class, which allows the user to define an experiment.

We define the `Experiment` class here which is the highest-level class of our framework. More specifically, it allows
to organize which tasks to run, which metrics to use, and allows to easily compare different models, algos, methods,
and so on.

An experiment should be well-defined, and clearly demonstrate the results.

Dependencies:
- `pyrobolearn.tasks`  (thus `pyrobolearn.envs`, `pyrobolearn.policies`, `pyrobolearn.approximators`,...)
- `pyrobolearn.metrics`
- `pyrobolearn.algos`

class Experiment(object):
    r"""Experiment class.

    An experiment allows to organize which tasks to run (and in which order), which metrics to use to
    evaluate the experiment, and to easily compare different learning models/rl, algos, and so on.
    This represents the highest level of our `pyrobolearn` framework. Sometimes, the robot, policy, or algo
    can be as well specified as an argument when creating an experiment.

    .. seealso: the second highest level of our framework is the `Task` class which defines the policy and
    environment, and is independent of the learning algorithm as well as the metrics.

    Examples:
        # 1st Example
        sim = Bullet()
        experiment = Experiment(sim) # this creates the task (states/actions, rl, environment), algo, metrics,...
        results = experiment.run(train=True, evaluate_metrics=True)
        experiment.plot_metrics()
        reward = experiment.evaluate_policy()

        # 2nd Example
        sim = Bullet()
        robots = [Robot(), Robot()]
        algo = Algo()
        experiment = Experiment(sim, robots, algo)
        results = experiment(train=True, evaluate_metrics=True)
        experiment.plot_metrics()
