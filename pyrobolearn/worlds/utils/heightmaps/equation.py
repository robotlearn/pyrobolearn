    Generate heightmap from 3D equation :math:`z = f(x,y)`.

    Args:
        x (np.array[N], np.array[N,O]): If 1d array, it will compute the meshgrid. Otherwise, the resulting 2D array
            from the meshgrid is expected. This is used to predict the heightmap at the given points.
        y (np.array[0], np.array[N,O]): If 1d array, it will compute the meshgrid. Otherwise, the resulting 2D array
            from the meshgrid is expected. This is used to predict the heightmap at the given points.
        z (callable): it must be a function that accepts two arguments `x` and `y` which will be the arrays from the
            meshgrid.
        min_height (int,float): lower bound; each value in the heightmap will be higher than or equal to this bound
        max_height (int,float): upper bound; each value in the heightmap will be lower than or equal to this bound
        dtype (np.int, np.float): type of the returned array for the heightmap

    Examples of 2D surfaces:
        z = lambda x,y: np.log(y)
        z = lambda x,y: np.sin(np.pi * x) * np.sin(np.pi * y)

    Returns:
        np.array[N,O]: resulting 2D heightmap
