"""Define the Myo armband sensor input interface.

Warnings: "Myo production has officially ended as of Oct 12, 2018 and is no longer available for purchase".

The Myo Armband has 8 EMG sensors (the sensor with the Myo logo is the 4th sensor, see picture on the web), and
an IMU sensor (which allows to get the orientation, acceleration from the accelerometer, and angular velocity
from the gyroscope).

The coordinate system is a right-handed coordinate system, and it is the same as the one used in robotics.
Once the armband is put on your arm and your elbow is bent at 90 degrees, the x-axis is pointing forward,
the y-axis is pointing to the left, and the z-axis is pointing upward. More information can be found on the web.

This implementation used a slightly modified ``Myo`` class from ``PyoConnect`` from [2], which inherits from
``MyoRaw`` from [3].
