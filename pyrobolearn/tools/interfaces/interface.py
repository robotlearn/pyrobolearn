"""Define the abstract interfaces

This defines the Input/Output abstract interfaces. They allowed to get information from input systems (such as
the mouse, keyboard, microphone, webcam/kinect, VR/AR tools, game controllers, and so on), and/or send information
to output systems (such as speakers, game controllers, VR/AR tools, etc).
These interfaces are independent from the rest of the code; they are not coupled to the simulator, robots, or world.
The code that connects the interfaces to the simulator or elements inside this last one are the `bridges` defined
in `pyrobolearn/tools/bridges`.

    The interface links input systems (such as the mouse, keyboard, microphone, webcam/kinect, VR/AR tools, game
    controllers, and so on), and/or output systems (such as speakers, game controllers, VR/AR tools, etc) to the
    simulator. Specifically, it can connects such systems to the `world`, `simulator`, or `robot`.

    They can be divided into 3 classes:
    * Input interfaces: these interfaces interpret the signals received by an input system, and act on the world.
                        Examples include the mouse, keyboard, microphone, webcam/kinect, joysticks, and others.
                        For more info, see the `InputInterface` class.
    * Output interfaces: these interfaces received signals from the world, and output these through an output system.
                         For instance, a robot could 'speak' in the world, and this signal could be redirected to
                         computer speakers or headphones. For more info, see the `OutputInterface` class.
    * Input and Output interfaces: these interfaces connects with a system that can be used as inputs and outputs.
                                   Such instances include controllers with feedback (using vibration or force),
                                   VR/AR tools, phones, etc. For more info, see the `InputOutputInterface` class.
