"""Define the haptic interface.

Prerequisites:
- follow instructions in [4] on how to install h3dapi.
- To use the Python library, you have to run `H3DLoad <file>.x3d` where in the `<file>.x3d` you make a reference to
the Python script you want to run. Inside this Python script, you will be able to access to the Python library
`H3DInterface`... This is bad... Need to find a better alternative.

Troubleshooting:
- Check: https://www.h3dapi.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/H3DAPI_FAQ#Python
-

Dependencies:
- `pyrobolearn.tools.interfaces`
