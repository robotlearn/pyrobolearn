class MouseKeyboardInterface(InputInterface):
    r"""Mouse Keyboard Interface for the simulator

    Provide the mouse keyboard interface which can for instance allows the user to interact with the world
    (and thus the robots) using the mouse and keyboard.

    For IK, you can perform it:
    * from one link to another link: select the first link by a `left-click` then the second link that you wish to move
                                     with a `right-click`
    * using the full-body: do not select any objects, and just `right-click` on the corresponding link
    You can also use the sliders to move the corresponding link. When using the mouse, it will move the selected link
    in the plane which is parallel to the camera (i.e. perpendicular to the axis that goes from the camera lens to
    the link), and contains the CoM of the selected link.

    Mouse:
    * predefined in pybullet
        * `scroll wheel`: zoom
        * `ctrl`/`alt` + `scroll button`: move the camera using the mouse
        * `ctrl`/`alt` + `left-click`: rotate the camera using the mouse
        * `left-click` and drag: transport the object

    Keyboard:
    * predefined in pybullet:
        * `w`: show the wireframe (collision shapes)
        * `s`: show the reference system
        * `v`: show bounding boxes
        * `g`: show/hide parts of the GUI the side columns (check `sim.configureDebugVisualizer(p.COV_ENABLE_GUI, 0)`)
        * `esc`: quit the simulator

    For programmers:
        In Pybullet, `sim.getMouseEvents()` return a list of mouse events in the following format:
        [(eventType, x, y, buttonIndex, buttonState)]
        where
        * `eventType` is 1 if the mouse is moving, 2 if a button has been pressed or released
        * `(x,y)` are the mouse position on the screen (expressed in pixel, and returned as float (they should be int))
        * `buttonIndex` is -1 if nothing, 0 if left button, 1 if scroll wheel (pressed), 2 if right button
        * `buttonState` is 0 if nothing, 3 if the button has been pressed, 4 is the button has been released,
            1 if the key is down (never observed), 2 if the key has been triggered (never observed).

        In Pybullet, `sim.getKeyboardEvents()` return a dictionary of key events in the following format:
            {keyID: keyState}
        where
        * `keyID` is an integer (ascii code) representing the key. Some special keys like shift, arrows, and others are
        are defined in pybullet such as `B3G_SHIFT`, `B3G_LEFT_ARROW`, `B3G_UP_ARROW`,...
        * `keyState` is an integer. 3 if the button has been pressed, 1 if the key is down, 2 if the key has been
        triggered, 4 if it has been released.
