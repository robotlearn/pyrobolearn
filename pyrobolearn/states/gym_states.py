        Args:
            gym_env (gym.Env): OpenAI gym environment
            window_size (int): window size of the state. This is the total number of states we should remember. That
                is, if the user wants to remember the current state :math:`s_t` and the previous state :math:`s_{t-1}`,
                the window size is 2. By default, the :attr:`window_size` is one which means we only remember the
                current state. The window size has to be bigger than 1. If it is below, it will be set automatically
                to 1. The :attr:`window_size` attribute is only valid when the state is not a combination of states,
                but is given some :attr:`data`.
            axis (int, None): axis to concatenate or stack the states in the current window. If you have a state with
                shape (n,), then if the axis is None (by default), it will just concatenate it such that resulting
                state has a shape (n*w,) where w is the window size. If the axis is an integer, then it will just stack
                the states in the specified axis. With the example, for axis=0, the resulting state has a shape of
                (w,n), and for axis=-1 or 1, it will have a shape of (n,w). The :attr:`axis` attribute is only when the
                state is not a combination of states, but is given some :attr:`data`.
            ticks (int): number of ticks to sleep before getting the next state data.
