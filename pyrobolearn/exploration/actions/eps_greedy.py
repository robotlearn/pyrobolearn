r"""Provide the discrete epsilon-greedy action exploration.

The epsilon-greedy exploration strategy consists to explore in the discrete action space of policies. Specifically,
it selects the best action :math:`a*` with probability :math:`p = (1 - \epsilon)`, or another action
:math:`a \in A\{a*}` randomly (based on uniform distribution) with probability :math:`p = \frac{\epsilon}{|A|-1}`.
