"""Define the Robot middleware API.

The robot middleware interface is an interface between a particular robot and the middleware. The middleware
possesses a list of Robot middleware interfaces (one for each robot). If you have a specific robot, you have to
implement this class otherwise it will use the provided default one.

For instance, when using ROS, the `RobotMiddleWare` is inherited by the `ROSRobotMiddleware` class from which all
ROS robot middlewares have to inherit from. A `DefaultROSRobotMiddleware` that inherits from the `ROSRobotMiddleware`

class RobotMiddleware(object):
    r"""Robot middleware interface.

    The robot middleware interface is an interface between a particular robot and the middleware. The middleware
    possesses a list of Robot middleware interfaces (one for each robot).

    Notably, the robot middleware has a unique id, has a list of publishers and subscribers associated with the given
    robot.

    Here are the possible combinations between the different values for subscribe (S), publish (P), teleoperate (T),
    and command (C):

    - S=1, P=0, T=0: subscribes to the topics, and get the messages when calling the corresponding getter methods.
    - S=0, P=1, T=0: publishes the various messages to the topics when calling the corresponding setter methods.
    - S=1, P=0, T=1, C=0/1: get messages by subscribing to the topics that publish some commands/states. The received
      commands/states are then set in the simulator. Depending on the value of `C`, it will subscribe to topics that
      publish some commands (C=1) or states (C=0). Example: should we subscribe to joint trajectory commands, or joint
      states when teleoperating the robot in the simulator? This C value allows to specify which one we are interested
      in.
    - S=0, P=1, T=1: when calling the getters methods such as joint positions, velocities, and others, it also
      publishes the joint states. This is useful if we are moving/teleoperating the robot in the simulator.
    - S=0, P=0, T=1/0: doesn't do anything.
    - S=1, P=1, T=0: subscribes to some topics and publish messages to other topics. The messages are can be
      sent/received by calling the appropriate getter/setter methods.
    - S=1, P=1, T=1: not allowed, because teleoperating the robot is not a two-way communication process.
