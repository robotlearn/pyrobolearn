class Middleware(object):
    r"""Middleware (abstract) class

    Middleware can be provided to simulators which can then use them to send/receive messages.

    Here are the possible combinations between the different values for subscribe (S), publish (P), teleoperate (T),
    and command (C):

    - S=1, P=0, T=0: subscribes to the topics, and get the messages when calling the corresponding getter methods.
    - S=0, P=1, T=0: publishes the various messages to the topics when calling the corresponding setter methods.
    - S=1, P=0, T=1, C=0/1: get messages by subscribing to the topics that publish some commands/states. The
      received commands/states are then set in the simulator. Depending on the value of `C`, it will subscribe to
      topics that publish some commands (C=1) or states (C=0). Example: should we subscribe to joint trajectory
      commands, or joint states when teleoperating the robot in the simulator? This C value allows to specify
      which one we are interested in.
    - S=0, P=1, T=1: when calling the getters methods such as joint positions, velocities, and others, it also
      publishes the joint states. This is useful if we are moving/teleoperating the robot in the simulator.
    - S=0, P=0, T=1/0: doesn't do anything.
    - S=1, P=1, T=0: subscribes to some topics and publish messages to other topics. The messages are can be
      sent/received by calling the appropriate getter/setter methods.
    - S=1, P=1, T=1: not allowed, because teleoperating the robot is not a two-way communication process.
