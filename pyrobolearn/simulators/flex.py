"""Define the Nvidia FleX Simulator API.

DEPRECATED: See `isaac.py`.

This is the main interface that communicates with the FleX simulator [1]. By defining this interface, it allows to
decouple the PyRoboLearn framework from the simulator. It also converts some data types to the ones required by
FleX.

Warnings: We are waiting for [3] to publish their code.

Dependencies in PRL:
* `pyrobolearn.simulators.simulator.Simulator`
