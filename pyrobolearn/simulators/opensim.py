"""Define the OpenSim Simulator API.

This is the main interface that communicates with the OpenSim simulator [1]. By defining this interface, it allows to
decouple the PyRoboLearn framework from the simulator. It also converts some data types to the ones required by
OpenSim.

Warnings: This simulator only works for musculoskeletal models.

Dependencies in PRL:
* `pyrobolearn.simulators.simulator.Simulator`
