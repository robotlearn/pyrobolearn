A cost is defined as an objective that penalizes a certain behavior.

    According to the authors of [1,2]: "We found the logistic kernel function to be more useful than Euclidean norm,
    which is a more common choice. An Euclidean norm generates a high cost in the beginning of training where the
    tracking error is high such that termination (i.e. falling) becomes more rewarding strategy. On the other hand,
    the logistic kernel ensures that the cost is lower-bounded by zero and termination becomes less favorable. Many
    other bell-shaped kernels (Gaussian, triweight, biweight, etc) have the same functionality and can be used instead
    of a logistic kernel."
