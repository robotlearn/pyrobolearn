    r"""Polynomial Function Approximator

    The polynomial function approximator is a discriminative deterministic model expressed mathematically as
    :math:`y = f(x) = W \phi(x)`, where :math:`x` is the input vector, :math:`y` is the output vector, :math:`W`
    is the weight matrix, and :math:`\phi` is the polynomial function which returns the transformed input vector.
    This transformed input vector is often of higher dimension, based on the idea that if it is not linear with
    respect to the parameters in the current space, it might be in a higher dimensional space.
