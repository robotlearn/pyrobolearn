"""Define the OpenAI Gym Action

This defines the OpenAI Gym action such that it is compatible with the pyrobolearn framework. It notably decouples
loosely the actions from the gym environment. Specifically, the `GymAction` allows to extract the shape of the action
from the gym environment, and keep it as an attribute of the class. This can then be used by other classes such as
the various policies defined in the pyrobolearn framework.
