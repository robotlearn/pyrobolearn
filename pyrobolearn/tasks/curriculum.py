"""Define the curriculum learning task.

This type of tasks starts by training agents on simple tasks/environments first and then increase the difficulty
level of tasks progressively.

This can be achieved in three different ways; discretely, continuously, or a mixture of both.
For instance, in a locomotion task where a robot has to learn how to walk, we can progressively increase the
difficulty level by:
- having different discrete type of worlds; starting from a world with a flat floor, passing to smooth terrains with
ups and downs, to a world filled with inanimate obstacles, to finally a lively world with different moving agents.
- modifying in a continuous manner the reward/cost function landscape. This can be achieved by increasing / decreasing
the coefficient values of some rewards/costs as the number of episodes/iterations progresses.
