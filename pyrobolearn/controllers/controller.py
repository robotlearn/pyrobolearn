    Controllers accept as inputs the robot's state (or observations), and outputs the joint actions. Compared to
    policies (as defined in `pyrobolearn/policies`), they do not possess any parameters to optimize. They are manually
    coded by the user. They can however use optimization processes inside the controller, such as quadratic
    programming.
