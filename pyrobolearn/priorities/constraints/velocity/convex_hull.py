r"""Provide the Convex Hull constraint.

This convex hull constraints make sure that the projected CoM position (in the x-y directions) belongs to the
convex hull (i.e. support polygon). This can be defined as:

.. math:: A_{CH} J_{CoM} \dot{q} dt \leq b_{CH} - A_{CH} x_{CoM} - d

where :math:`A_{CH} \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times 2}` and :math:`b_{CH} \in \mathbb{R}^F` are the matrix and vector
that appears in the convex hull hyperplane equation :math:`A_{CH} x \leq b_{CH}`, where :math:`F` is the number
of facets in the convex hull, :math:`J_{CoM} \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times N}` is the truncated CoM Jacobian that only
accounts for the x and y direction components, :math:`\dot{q}` are the joint velocities being optimized,
:math:`x_{CoM} \in \mathbb{R}^2` is the current position of the CoM (due to the current joint configuration
:math:`q`) in the x-y directions, :math:`dt` is the integration time step, and :math:`d` is a safety margin
distance. Note that :math:`A_{CH}` has also be truncated to only take into account the x-y components (i.e.
:math:`A_{CH} \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times 2}` and not :math:`A_{CH} \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times 3}`).

This formulation can be rewritten as a upper unilateral inequality constraint :math:`A_{ineq} x \leq b_u` in QP,
with :math:`x = \dot{q}`, :math:`A_{ineq} = A_{CH} J_{CoM} dt`, and :math:`b_u = b_{CH} - A_{CH} x_{CoM} - d`.

Note that computing the ConvexHull at each time step can be quite expensive from a computing point of view, as
such you can specify the number of ticks to sleep before the next computation.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2), but we use the
`scipy.spatial.ConvexHull` class [2].
