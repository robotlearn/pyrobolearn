    Definition: "For a biped in state :math:`x`, a Capture Point (CP) :math:`P`, is a point on the ground such that
    if the biped covers :math:`P` (makes its base of support include :math:`P`), either with its stance foot or by
    stepping to :math:`P` in a single step, and then maintains its Center of Pressure (CoP) to lie on :math:`P`, then
    there exists a safe feasible trajectory leading to a capture state (i.e. a state in which the kinetic energy of
    the biped is zero and can remain zero with suitable joint torque (note that the CoM must lie above the CoP in a
    capture state))." [1] "Intuitively, the CP is the point on the floor onto which the robot has to step to come
    to a complete rest" [2].
