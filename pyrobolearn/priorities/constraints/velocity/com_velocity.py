r"""Provide the Center of Mass velocity constraint.

The bilateral inequality CoM velocity constraint is given by:

.. math:: v_{lb} \leq J_{CoM}(q) \dot{q} \leq v_{ub}

where :math:`v_{lb}, v_{ub}` are the lower and upper bound of the CoM velocities, :math:`\dot{q}` are the joint
velocities being optimized, and :math:`J_{CoM}(q)` is the CoM Jacobian.

This formulation can be rewritten as a bilateral inequality constraint :math:`b_l \leq A_{ineq} x \leq b_u` in QP,
with :math:`x = \dot{q}`, :math:`A_{ineq} = J_{CoM}(q)`, :math:`b_l = v_{lb}` and :math:`b_u = v_{ub}`.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).
