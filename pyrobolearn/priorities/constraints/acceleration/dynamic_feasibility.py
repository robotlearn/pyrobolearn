r"""Provide the dynamic feasibility constraint.

The equality dynamic feasibility constraint is given by:

.. math:: H(q) \ddot{q} + N(q, \dot{q}) = \sum_i J_i^T F_i

where :math:`H(q)` is the joint space inertia matrix, :math:`\ddot{q}` are the joint accelerations being optimized,
:math:`N(q, \dot{q})` is the vector of force terms that account for the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, gravity,
and any other forces acting on the system other than the contact forces given by :math:`\sum_i J_i^T F_i` (where
each :math:`J_i` is a Jacobian matrix and :math:`F_i` is a wrench vector at the contact link :math:`i`).

This formulation can be rewritten as an equality constraint math:`A_{eq} x = b_{eq}` in QP, with
:math:`x = \ddot{q}`, :math:`A_{eq} = H(q)`, and :math:`b_{eq} = \sum_i J_i^T F_i - N(q, \dot{q})`.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).
