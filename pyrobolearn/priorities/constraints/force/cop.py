class CoPConstraint(Constraint):
    r"""Center of Pressure (CoP) constraint.

    "The CoP is the point on the ground where the resultant of the ground-reaction force acts". [1]

    This is defined mathematically as:

    .. math::

        x_{CoP} = \frac{\sum_i x_i f^i_n}{\sum_i f^i_n}
        y_{CoP} = \frac{\sum_i y_i f^i_n}{\sum_i f^i_n}
        z_{CoP} = \frac{\sum_i z_i f^i_n}{\sum_i f^i_n}

    where :math:`[x_i, y_i, z_i]` are the coordinates of the contact point :math:`i` on which the normal force
    :math:`f^i_n` acts.

    Notes:
        - the ZMP and CoP are equivalent for horizontal ground surfaces. For irregular ground surfaces they are
        distinct. [2]
