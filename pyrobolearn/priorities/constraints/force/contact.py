r"""Provide the contact (force normal) constraint.

The lower unilateral contact force constraint is given by :math:`0 \leq f^i_n` where :math:`f^i_n` is the normal
force with respect to the contact surface applied on the link in contact :math:`i` defined in the local frame.

The optimization variables are these contact forces :math:`f^i_n` expressed in the world frame, thus they are
rotated to their local frame. This formulation can be rewritten as a unilateral inequality constraint
:math:`b_l \leq A_{ineq} x` in QP, with :math:`x = f^w \in \mathbb{R}^{6N_c}` which is the concatenation of all
the contact force variables (one for each contact point) expressed in the world frame,
:math:`A_{ineq} = R^l_w \in \mathbb{R}^{6N_c \times 6N_c}` is the block diagonal matrix that rotates the force
variables expressed in the world frame :math:`w` to their respective local frame :math:`l`, and
:math:`b_l = [-\infty, -\infty, 0, -\infty, -\infty, -\infty] * N_c`, where :math:`N_c` is the total number of
contact points.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1].
