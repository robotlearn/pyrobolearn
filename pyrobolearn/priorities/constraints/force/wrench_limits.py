r"""Provide the wrench limits constraint.

This provides bounds/limits on the wrenches:

.. math::  F_{lb} \leq F \leq F_{ub}

where :math:`(F_{lb}, F_{ub})` are the lower and upper bound on the wrenches, and
:math:`F` is the wrench vector being optimized.

This formulation can be rewritten as the inequality constraint math:`lb \leq x \leq ub` in QP, with
:math:`lb = F_{lb}`, :math:`ub = F_{ub}`, and :math:`x = F`. This can also be rewritten as :math:`Gx \leq h`,
with :math:`G = [-I, I]^\top` and :math:`h = [-F_{lb}^\top, F_{ub}^\top]^\top` where :math:`I` is the square
identity matrix.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).
