The contact task tries to minimize the movement of a contact link:

.. math:: || C J_c(q) \dot{q} ||^2,

where :math:`C \in \mathbb{R}^{6 \times 6}` is the contact matrix (=a diagonal selector matrix where the entries
are 1 for cartesian velocities that we wish to minimize such that the link doesn't move, and 0 for cartesian
velocities that are free to change), :math:`J_c(q)` is the contact Jacobian (the Jacobian from the world frame to
the contact point), and :math:`\dot{q}` are the joint velocities being optimized.

This is equivalent to the QP objective function :math:`||Ax - b||^2`, by setting :math:`A = C J_c(q)`,
:math:`x = \dot{q}`, and :math:`b = 0`.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).

    r"""Contact Task

    The contact task tries to minimize the movement of a contact link:

    .. math:: || C J_c(q) \dot{q} ||^2,

    where :math:`C \in \mathbb{R}^{6 \times 6}` is the contact matrix (=a diagonal selector matrix where the entries
    are 1 for cartesian velocities that we wish to minimize such that the link doesn't move, and 0 for cartesian
    velocities that are free to change), :math:`J_c(q)` is the contact Jacobian (the Jacobian from the world frame to
    the contact point expressed in the distal link frame (i.e. the link which is in contact)), and :math:`\dot{q}` are
    the joint velocities being optimized.
    Note that because the jacobian is expressed in the distal link frame, the entries of the contact matrix specify
    the velocities that are fixed or can move in that particular frame. For instance, [0,0,1,0,0,0] means that the z
    linear velocity (where z is the z axis of the distal link frame) is fixed.

    This is equivalent to the QP objective function :math:`||Ax - b||^2`, by setting :math:`A = C J_c(q)`,
    :math:`x = \dot{q}`, and :math:`b = 0`.

    This task is useful for instance if we want to keep the feet in contact with the ground.
