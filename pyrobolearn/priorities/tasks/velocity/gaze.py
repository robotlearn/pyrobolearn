class GazeTask(JointVelocityTask):
    r"""Gaze Task

    The Gaze class implement a Cartesian Task in which the gaze of the robot is controlled. This is achieved by
    controlling the orientation of the distal link equipped with a camera (this can for instance be the head of a
    robot) with respect to a base frame (which can be the neck or waist for instance). For this purpose, from the
    Cartesian sub-task only the pitch and yaw velocities are considered.

    The implementation is based on [1] which itself is inspired from [2].
