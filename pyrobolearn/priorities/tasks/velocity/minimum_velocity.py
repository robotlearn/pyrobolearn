r"""Provide the minimum velocity task.

The minimum velocity task minimizes the joint velocities, that is it minimizes:

.. math:: ||\dot{q}||^2,

which is equivalent to the QP objective function :math:`||Ax - b||^2`, by setting :math:`A=I`, :math:`x=\dot{q}`,
and :math:`b=0`.

This minimum velocity task is often used in conjunction with other tasks such as `PosturalTask` or `CartesianTask`.

Note that this can also be achieved with the `tasks.velocity.PosturalTask` by setting the desired joint velocities to
zeros and not providing the desired joint positions.


The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).
