class PureRollingTask(JointVelocityTask):
    r"""Pure rolling (no-sliding) Task

    The pure rolling without slipping constrained the end-effector contact point (with the ground) to remain fixed:

    .. math:: v_{cp} = 0

    where :math:`v_{cp}` is the contact point velocity given by :math:`v_{cp} = \dot{x}_{cp}` where :math:`x_{cp}` is
    the position vector (from the world frame origin) to the contact point.

    The optimization problem can be formulated as:

    .. math:: || S J_c(q) \dot{q} ||^2

    where :math:`S = [0_{3 \times 3}, 1_{3 \times 3}]` is a selector matrix that selects the cartesian linear
    velocities from :math:`J_c(q)`, which is the Jacobian of the contact point between the wheel and
    the ground (in the world frame), and :math:`\dot{q}` are the joint velocities being optimized.
