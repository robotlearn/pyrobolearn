r"""Provide the dynamic feasibility task (which is based on the dynamic feasibility constraint).

The equality joint acceleration constraint is given by:

.. math:: H(q) \ddot{q} + N(q, \dot{q}) = \sum_i J_i^T F_i

where :math:`H(q)` is the joint space inertia matrix, :math:`\ddot{q}` are the joint accelerations being optimized,
:math:`N(q, \dot{q})` is the vector of force terms that account for the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, gravity,
and any other forces acting on the system other than the contact forces given by :math:`\sum_i J_i^T F_i` (where
each :math:`J_i` is a Jacobian matrix and :math:`F_i` is a wrench vector at the contact link :math:`i`).

This formulation can be rewritten as an equality constraint math:`A_{eq} x = b_{eq}` in QP, with
:math:`x = \ddot{q}`, :math:`A_{eq} = H(q)`, and :math:`b_{eq} = \sum_i J_i^T F_i - N(q, \dot{q})`.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).

class DynamicFeasibilityTask(JointAccelerationTask):
    r"""Dynamic Feasibility Task

    The dynamic feasibility constraint tries to enforce the joint space dynamic equation of motion given by
    :math:`H(q) \ddot{q} + N(q, \dot{q}) = \sum_i J_i^T F_i`. This is a softer version of the corresponding equality
    constraint (see `priorities/constraints/acceleration/dynamic_feasibility.py`).

    The task minimizes:

    .. math:: || H(q) \ddot{q} - (\sum_i J_i^T F_i - N(q, \dot{q})) ||^2,

    where :math:`H(q)` is the joint space inertia matrix, :math:`\ddot{q}` are the joint accelerations being optimized,
    :math:`N(q, \dot{q})` is the vector of force terms that account for the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, gravity,
    and any other forces acting on the system other than the contact forces given by :math:`\sum_i J_i^T F_i` (where
    each :math:`J_i` is a Jacobian matrix and :math:`F_i` is a wrench vector at the contact link :math:`i`).

    This is equivalent to the QP objective function :math:`||Ax - b||^2`, by setting :math:`A=H(q)`,
    :math:`x=\ddot{q}`, and :math:`b = \sum_i J_i^T F_i - N(q, \dot{q})`.

    Compared to the constraint, this task can be violated during the optimization. The user can set the weight to
    specify how much this task can be violated.
