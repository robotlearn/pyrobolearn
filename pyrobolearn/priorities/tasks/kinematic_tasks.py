    While optimizing, the robot can get to weird configurations. This postural kinematic task tries to keep the
    robot's kinematic configuration close to the given default joint positions. This task is usually put at the end of
    the stack of tasks, once all the other tasks have been fulfilled.

    The A matrix is the identity matrix, the variables being optimized are the joint velocities :math:`\dot{q}`, and

    :math:`\epsilon` are respectively the scalar and vector part of the quaternion.
    The quaternion error :math:`\Delta Q` is given by :math:`Q_d * Q_e^{-1}`.

    Once the optimal joint velocities :math:`\dot{q}^*` have been computed, they can be given to a velocity controller,
    or a position controller using :math:`q = q + \dot{q}^* dt`, with :math:`dt` being the control loop period.
