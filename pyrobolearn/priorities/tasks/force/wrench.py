r"""Provide the wrench task.

The wrench task tries to generate a wrench near the desired one by minimizing:

.. math:: || w - k (w_{des} - w_t) ||^2

where :math:`w = [f \tau] \in \mathbb{R}^6` is the wrench vector being optimized, :math:`k` is a proportional gain,
:math:`w_{des}` is the desired wrench vector, and :math:`w_t` is the current wrench vector.

The above formulation is equivalent to the QP objective function :math:`||Ax - b||^2`, by setting
:math:`A = I`, :math:`x = w`, and :math:`b = k (w_{des} - w_t)`.

The implementation of this class is inspired by [1] (which is licensed under the LGPLv2).
