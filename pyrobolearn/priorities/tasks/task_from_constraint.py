r"""Transform a given equality constraint into a task.

An equality constraint specified by :math:`Fx = k` is transformed to a soft task :math:`||Ax - b||^2`, where
:math:`A = F` and :math:`b = k`. This allows for the equality constraint to be lightly violated; by specifying the
weight :math:`W` we can specify how much the constraint should be satisfied.
