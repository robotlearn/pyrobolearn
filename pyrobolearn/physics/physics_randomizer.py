class PhysicsRandomizer(object):
    r"""Physics Randomizer

    This the main abstract class from which all the physics randomizers inherit from. A physics randomizer randomize
    the physics properties of a certain object. This can be, for instance, the world, a robot, or a particular link /
    joint of that robot.

    It can change for example the dynamics of a particular object such as the mass, inertia, or others. It can also
    change their physical properties such as the friction, bounciness (restitution coefficient), etc.

    Note that the physics randomizer instance has access to the simulator in order to modify the physical properties.
    Also, note that normally the physics randomizer is called at the beginning of an episode, and not at each time
    step. Changing the physical properties at each time step can lead to weird behaviors.

    It is possible to not randomize some physical properties by specifying a specific value instead of a range (=tuple
    of 2 values; lower and upper bound), or by setting None.
